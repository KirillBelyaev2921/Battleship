# Battleship
Battleship on Swing that allows plays two players on the same local network

This is snapshot of version 1 of programm.

My first big and completed (somehow) project, for the Battleship game on two players. 
The idea is to play Battleship in local network, using most of my knowlege and skills 
to write it. I am not wery good and using sockets and threads, so it was my first project,
where I used them. In the end, my code became more complicated and bad, and also there are many
bugs and mistakes, that I don't know how to fix (for example, how to break the connection when user just close Frame).
In the future, I will work on this project, when I learn about (such as javadoc and more for sockets).

In the end, this project was made after I read the book "Head First Java" by Kathy Sierra, ‎Bert Bates, ‎Trisha Gee.
It was very usefull for me to structure my knowledge and learn new things. After some more books I will return and
change it into the real multiplayer Battleship game.
