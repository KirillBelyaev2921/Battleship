# Battleship
Battleship on Swing that allows plays two players on the same local network

This is snapshot of version 3.0 of program.

After reading about design patterns, I yet again understood, 
that my knowledge and experience is not enough keep tracking on so many things, as gui, sockets,
patterns and so on. While refactoring I also noticed, that i didn't have to change my socket classes much,
which is already a good sign. But, changing It is all to mvc with observer cause me a little pain,
so I think to do something less complicated.

So, before implementing Bots to Battleship game, I will try to design and develop Minesweeper game.
There, I don't need many Panels or sockets, so I'll focus on code style, patterns and design principles.

Also, I began to read "Effective Java", so after some practice I will return to this project and, hopefully,
will design much better in version 3.1.
